<title>A simple HTML+ Document</title>
<h1 id="a1">This is a level one header</h1>
<p>This is some normal text which will wrap at the window margin.
You can emphasise <em>parts of the text</em> if you wish.</p>
<p>This is a new paragraph. Note that unlike title and header tags
the matching end tag is not needed.</p>
